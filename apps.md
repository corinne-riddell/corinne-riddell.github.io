<h2>Web applications and teaching tools</h2>

<p>I have created web applications to aid epidemiologists in performing calculations and teach epidemiologic concepts.</p>

**[Sample size calculator for panel studies](https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/mcgilleboh-samplesizecalculator/)**
  * Calculate the minimal sample size when you have panel data and a continuous outcome
  * Accompanies a forthcoming paper in *Epidemiology* by Scott Weichenthal et al.

**[The misleading odds ratio](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0LpZ0kOzhDTNE9JMXlKV3BGaFhQZEw1VFdsb3ZrZThXZWg0)**
  * This spreadsheet demonstrates how the average risk difference is the only incident measure of association to correctly estimate a measure of average causal effect (under no assumptions).
  * Facilitates the classic epidemiology reading [*Interpretation and choice of effect measures in epidemiologic analyses*](http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Greenland%20S%201987%20interpretation%20and%20choice%20of%20effect%20measures.pdf) by Sander Greenland (1987).
