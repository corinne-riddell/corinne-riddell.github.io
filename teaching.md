title: “Teaching Resources”
---

I have developed and delivered numerous lectures to PhD students and medical residents. I was a co-instructor of an undergraduate Statistics course during my Master’s degree at the University of British Columbia, and a teaching assistant for two Statistics courses during my Master’s and one Mathematics course during my Bachelor’s degree. I was awarded two prizes for teaching: the Statistical Department Graduate Teaching Assistant Award, and the Killam Graduate Teaching Assistant Award.
