	<h2>Corinne Riddell. Social and Perinatal Epidemiologist at UC Berkeley, School of Public Health.</h2>
	<p><img class="profile-picture" src="corinne-snake-dyke.jpg" alt="Corinne Riddell" hspace=20 width="30%" style="float:left;"/>I am a social and perinatal epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics within the School of Public Health at the University of California, in Berkeley. My current research focus is health inequalities between racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups in the United States. I have an ongoing body of work that seeks to understand why Black men and women have a shorter life expectancy than white men and women in the United States (<a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/black-white-life-expectancy/">app</a>, <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/25/140152">pre-print</a>, <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1353829217307153"><Research article/a>, <a href="https://github.com/corinne-riddell/BlackWhiteMortalityGap">GitHub repository</a>).
		I have also investigated differences in trends in US infant mortality by race (<a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2633490">paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/corinne-riddell/InfantMortality">GitHub repository</a>) and in quality of obstetric care between First Nations and non-First Nations women in British Columbia, Canada (<a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/2/E36.long">paper</a>). I have another stream of research in perinatal epidemiology and have worked as a consultant for the World Health Organization to inform the design of randomized controlled trials of vaccines during pregnancy. <br/><br/>
		I also create web tools to facilitate epidemiologists in performing calculations:
		<ul>
		<li>A <a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/mcgilleboh-samplesizecalculator/">sample size calculator</a> to help researchers calculate sample size in studies with repeated measurements (i.e., panel data) and continuous outcomes.</li>
		<li><a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/e-value-calculator/">e-value calculator</a> for easy e-value calculation, a measure of confounding bias neccesary to nullify an estimated effect in an observational study.</li>
		</ul></p>
