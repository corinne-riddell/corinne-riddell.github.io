	<p><img class="profile-picture" src="corinne-snake-dyke.jpg" alt="Corinne Riddell" hspace=20 width="30%" style="float:left;"/>Dr. Corinne Riddell, PhD MSc, is a social and perinatal epidemiologist, and an Assistant Adjunct Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health in the Divisions of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. Dr. Riddell leads a body of research on US racial inequalities in health, with a specific interest in measuring how some states have fared better than others at reducing disparities. She also collaborates on perinatal and pediatric epidemiologic research topics and is currently involved in research on environmental causes of preterm birth, developing a better classification of intrauterine growth restriction, and examining child maltreatment during the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr. Riddell uses interactive data visualization to explore these topics, as well as sophisticated surveillance and causal methodologies. In Fall 2018, she headed the evolution of PH142 (Introduction to Biostatistics in Public Health), to incorporate R for data science, and introduce students to data manipulation and visualization as part of their public health education. <br/><br/>
		I also create web tools to facilitate epidemiologists in performing calculations:
		<ul>
		<li>A <a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/mcgilleboh-samplesizecalculator/">sample size calculator</a> to help researchers calculate sample size in studies with repeated measurements (i.e., panel data) and continuous outcomes.</li>
		<li><a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/e-value-calculator/">e-value calculator</a> for easy e-value calculation, a measure of confounding bias neccesary to nullify an estimated effect in an observational study.</li>
		</ul></p>
