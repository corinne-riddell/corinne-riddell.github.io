	<h2>Corinne Riddell.	    social epidemiologist + R Shiny developer.</h2>
	<p>Iâ€™m a social epidemiologist and post doctoral researcher at McGill University, based in Montreal. My research focuses on health inequalities between racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. I have spent the past year developing a web application to understand why blacks have a shorter life expectancy than whites in the United States (<a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/black-white-life-expectancy/">app</a>, <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/25/140152">working paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/corinne-riddell/BlackWhiteMortalityGap">GitHub repository</a>).<br/><br/> 
		I have also investigated differences in trends in infant mortality by race (<a href="https://github.com/corinne-riddell/InfantMortality">GitHub repository</a>) and in quality of obstetric care between First Nations and non-First Nations women in British Columbia (<a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/2/E36.long">paper</a>). Previously, I studied variation in obstetrical practice across hospitals in Canada and the US.<br/><br/>
		Beyond my interests in social epidemiology, I love creating data visualizations and data tools more broadly. Some of my recent projects include:<br/><br/>
		- A <a href="https://corinne-riddell.shinyapps.io/mcgilleboh-samplesizecalculator/">sample size calculator</a> to help researchers calculate sample size in studies with repeated measurements (i.e., panel data) and continuous outcomes.<br/><br/>
		- A <a href="http://rpubs.com/corinne-riddell/283316">report</a> of US state-level trends in drug overdose mortality since 1979.
